# Gulp Roast Coffee Responsive Design
In this challenge, you will create a responsive website design for a fictitious coffee company’s website that includes a home page, an about page, and a products page. Responsive website designs with grid-based layouts, media queries, and images that resize are a standard of modern web design. As a designer, you will create designs that support your users no matter what devices they are using to access your content. By creating a responsive website design, you’ll gain a greater understanding of how developers use the same content to create different designs. This understanding may impact your workflow and how you communicate with developers in the future.
## Background
Gulp Roast Coffee sells whole-bean and ground coffee to retail customers (B2C) as well as wholesale customers (B2B), such as restaurants. Currently, individuals can purchase coffee from one Gulp Roast Coffee storefront, from retailers (grocery stores), and from farmers’ markets. You’ve been working as a researcher on Gulp’s UX design team to help the company redesign its website. In the previous module, you structured and styled the about page of Gulp Roast’s site as part of this redesign.
For this challenge, you will take the next steps with that design to make the page responsive. You’ve been given Figma files that show what the site will look like on mobile, tablet, and desktop dimensions. Using these, you’ll create two other responsive pages for the site (home page and products page) and link all three pages together for a complete site.
Required Deliverables
You’ll submit one deliverable:
A link to your GitHub Pages site.


# Instructions
In this challenge, you’ll apply your responsive design skills and your knowledge of using VS Code and GitHub to design and publish a website for Gulp Roast Coffee. Use the provided Figma Resources and M10 Challenge Assets. You will create and submit a link to your published website following these steps:
## Part 1: Move from CodePen to VS Code (2-3 hours)
Move the code for the about page into VS Code files from the CodePen. NOTE: Use a consistent folder structure and naming convention for your projects.

1. Create a folder on your local computer. 
2. Open VS Code and open your local folder in VS code. 
3. Create new files in your project folder:
    * Right click on the folder that the VS Code file explorer is and select “New File”.
    * Create about.html for your HTML code.
    * Create styles.css for your CSS code.
4. Transfer HTML from CodePen 
    * Copy the HTML code from CodePen. 
    * Paste into the about.html file in VS Code. 
    * Link to the stylesheet by inserting this following line of code `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` in the `<head>` section.
5. Transfer CSS from CodePen. 
    * Copy the CSS code from CodePen.
    * Paste it into styles.css  
6. Link to any Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons. Work with the Font Awesome CDN link or with individual SVG files.
7. Save all files: shortcut Ctrl+K+S (Windows/Linux) Cmd+K+S (Mac)
8. Test your work by opening the HTML page in your browser.
## Part 2: Update the code to be responsive (3-5 hours)
1. In the HTML for the about page:
    * Link to image files in `<source>` and `<img>` elements within the `<picture>` element. Be sure to include the alt attribute in any `<img>` elements.
    * As needed, add classes or sectioning elements to your HTML. 
2. In the CSS:
    * Change the code to be responsive. 
    * Turn on the border-box model. 
    * Write media queries for at least two different viewport sizes, including medium and large. These media queries should include:
        * Grid-based layouts using CSS flexbox and/or CSS grid that are different for each viewport size.
        * Responsive background images, as needed.
3. Add a responsive image to the about page. The image should have a horizontal orientation on a desktop, a vertical orientation on tablet dimensions, and a small horizontal image on mobile dimensions.
4. Save your files. 
5. Validate your code. 
6. Preview the page in your browser.
## Part 3: Create the product page (3-5 hours) 
Using the provided assets, create a responsive web design for Gulp Roast’s product page.
Do a File - Save As for the about page, saving this as products.html for your product page. Then, in the .html file for the product page:

Copy and paste the content into the VS Code file. 
Code the content with accurate semantic HTML. 
Use sectioning elements to break the page into its semantic parts. 
Link to image files in `<img>` elements. Be sure to include the alt attribute in any `<img>` elements and to set the width so the image resizes. 
As needed, add to the media queries in the .css file to include: 
Grid-based layouts using CSS flexbox and/or CSS grid that are different for each viewport size.
Background images, as needed.
Save your files. 
Validate your code. 
Preview the page in your browser.
## Part 4: Create the home page (3-5 hours) 
Using the provided assets, create a responsive web design for Gulp Roast’s home page. 
Do a File - Save As for the about page, saving this as index.htmlfor your home page. Then, in the index.html file:
Update the page title in the HTML boilerplate. 
Copy and paste the content into the VS Code file. 
Code the content with accurate semantic HTML. 
Use sectioning elements to break the page into its semantic parts. 
Link to image files in `<img>` elements. Be sure to include the alt attribute in any `<img>` elements and to set the width so the image resizes. 
As needed, add to the media queries in the .css file to include: 
Grid-based layouts using CSS flexbox and/or CSS grid that are different for each viewport size.
Background images, as needed.
Save your files. 
Validate your code. 
Preview the page in your browser.
## Part 5: Link your pages together (1-2 hours) 
On each of the three pages: 
Update the links in the navigation bar to link all of the pages together. 
Open each page in your browser and ensure that all of the links work. 
Validate your code, check your semantic elements, and test your site (including all links) in the browser. 
Use GitHub Pages to publish your website. Note: When you submit this assignment, you’ll submit the URL of the live site.
Once your site is on GitHub Pages, check to make sure everything loads and all links work correctly.
